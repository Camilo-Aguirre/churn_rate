# Churn Rate

## Project description

In this project with information from Databel (a telecom company in the US), we get to analyze a large dataset including demographical details from clients to visualize metrics about the clients' preferences and disclose the foundations of their decisions regarding churning, unsubscribing, and changing services.

## Objective

Figure out why customers are churning at the rate they are, by visualizing the dataset and calculating new measures that enable the understanding of tendencies. Create an eye-catching report in PowerBI.
